# osrs-gimp-tracker-frontend
Front end for tracking OSRS clients (Data received from backend, and backend receives data from runelite plugin)

Map regions/chunks textures are not included in the project, they are generated by runelite map dumper (see forked repo on my account, runelite-map-tile-generator)
